# DSABot
DSABot is a discord bot for all things programming. It inldues commands for local leaderboard, problem recommendation, saving username, rating updates, etc.

## Hosting Service
As of now DSABot is hosted locally on my computer. In the future I plan to get a raspberry pi in order to host it there.
